## Running

    $ sbt run

## Configuration

Tune example `horta.properties` file. All options are self-explanatory.

## Command system

Commands may be entered in MUC (multi-user chat) or private chat with bot (private commands do not work for now).

Command syntax:

    $command argument1 argument2

or

    command/argument1/argument2/

Characters inside every argument and the command name itself may be escaped with the `\`.

Known command list:

* `$say` - query the Markov network (generated for the sender) to generate random phrase.

* `$s what_to_replace replace_with` - designed to be similar to Perl `s///` command. Replaces first argument with the second argument, taking the last
sender phrase as the base.

* `$pet` - Tamagochi-like plugin, contains complex subcommand system. Enter `$pet help` for details.

* `$â™¥` - did you know that robots can love too?
